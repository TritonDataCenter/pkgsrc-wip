For pkgsrc installations, DAViCal's package is installed in non-default
locations:

	Document root:		${DAVICALDIR}/htdocs
	Configuration file:	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config.php

If you are upgrading from a previous version, see

	http://wiki.davical.org/w/Release_Notes

for how to perform a database upgrade.

To complete the installation of DAViCal, follow these steps:

1. Create DAViCal's app (application) and dba (database admin) acounts.
   Depending on your PostgreSQL setup, this could be done in different
   ways, like:

	$ su pgsql
	$ createuser -D -R -S --pwprompt davical_app
	<enter davical_app passwd>
	$ createuser -D -R -S --pwprompt davical_dba
	<enter davical_dba passwd>

   Consider editing pg_hba.conf file to grant access for both accounts
   to the soon to be created 'davical' database.

2. Adapt DAViCal's configuration files to your setup:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/administration.yml	(used for davical_dba)
	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config.php		(used for davical_app)

   Look for 'pg_connect', 'system_name', 'admin_email', and 'default_locale'
   in config.php.

3. To ease DAViCal's database creation, you can use the following script:

	${DAVICALDIR}/dba/create-database.sh

   To work properly, it needs to be executed with a PostgreSQL's superuser
   account, and requires access to administration.yml file (see step 2.).

   At the end, the script will output the password of the www 'admin'
   account for DAViCal. Keep it in mind, it will be used at step 5.

4. You will need to make DAViCal accessible through your HTTP server.
   If you are running Apache and ap-php, you can use the following file:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/davical.conf

   and add an Include directive directly within Apache configuration:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/davical.conf

   then restart Apache. Note that Davical requires the following PHP
   extensions to be loaded: pdo.so, pdo_pgsql.so, pgsql.so, iconv.so and
   gettext.so.

5. You should now be able to access DAViCal through the URL configured
   at step 4. At login page, enter the following credentials:

	Login: admin
	Password: <the one obtained in step 3.>

   Validate, then follow the steps to create user accounts. See DAViCal
   online documentation for further information:

bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers. Column storage
allows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of columns. It also
allows for cheap addition and removal of column. In addition, bcolz objects
are compressed by default for reducing memory/disk I/O needs. The
compression process is carried out internally by Blosc, a high-performance
compressor that is optimized for binary data

  simulavr asks for libiberty.a.
  With avr-gcc 4.5.3 and avr-binutils-2.23.2, binutils is installing
  libiberty.a
  But with new binutils-2.24, it won't install libiberty. Instead, 
  avr-gcc-4.8.3 will provied libiberty.
  Makefile (of simulavr) now has pointer to PATH of libiberty now
  as:
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        --with-libiberty=${PREFIX}/lib/gcc/avr

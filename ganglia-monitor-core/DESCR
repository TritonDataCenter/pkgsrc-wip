Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical
design targeted at federations of clusters. It relies on a multicast-based
listen/announce protocol to monitor state within clusters and uses a tree of
point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to federate
clusters and aggregate their state. It leverages widely used technologies such
as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and
RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data
structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high
concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set
of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on
over 500 clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across
university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with
2000 nodes.

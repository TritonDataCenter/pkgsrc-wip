  All code in this server was written from scratch.

  The server is mostly compatible with livingston radiusd-2.01
  (no menus or s/key support though) but with more feautures, such as:

    o Can limit max. number of simultaneous logins on a per-user basis!
    o Multiple DEFAULT entries, that can optionally fall-through.
    o In fact, every entry can fall-through
    o Deny/permit access based on huntgroup users dials into
    o Set certain parameters (such as static IP address) based on huntgroup
    o Extra "hints" file that can select SLIP/PPP/rlogin based on
      username pattern (Puser or user.ppp is PPP, plain "user" is rlogin etc).
    o Can execute an external program when user has authenticated (for example
      to run a sendmail queue).
    o Can use `$INCLUDE filename' in radiusd.conf, users, and dictionary files
    o Can act as a proxy server, relaying requests to a remote server
    o Supports Vendor-Specific attributes
    o No good documentation at all, just like the original radiusd 1.16!

  Then of course for general RADIUS questions, especially if you are using
  Livingston  / Lucent RABU equipment, there is the portmaster-radius mailing
  list. Send mail to portmaster-radius-request@livingston.com to find
  out how to subscribe.

elfcat dumps requested parts (sections and segments) of an ELF file
(executable, shared object, .o file) to stdout.

Dumping sections can be achieved with "objcopy --dump-section" but this
tools relies on BFD which abstracts all executable files and is not able
to see some ELF sections.  Morever it cannot handle program header table
entries.

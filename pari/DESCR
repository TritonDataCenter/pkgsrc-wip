PARI-GP is a package which is aimed at efficient computations in
number theory, but also contains a large number of other useful
functions.  It is somewhat related to a Computer Algebra System, but
is not really one since it treats symbolic expressions as mathematical
entities such as matrices, polynomials, series, etc..., and not as
expressions per se.  However it is often much faster than other CAS,
and contains a large number of specific functions not found elsewhere,
essentially for use in number theory.

This package can be used in an interactive shell (GP) or as a C/C++
library (PARI). It is free software, in the sense of freedom AND 'free
of charge'.

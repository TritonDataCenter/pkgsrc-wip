Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:

  + Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any
      modifications to the core source
  + Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture
  + Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions
  + Split the work between multiple developers

The changes implemented should have little impact on vim's editing model or
vimscript in general. Most vimscript plugins should continue to work normally.

- Investigate if we should install TESTS, if yes patches/patch-aa needed to be
  adjusted accordingly like devel/tig
- Review patches/patch-include_tig_display.h, I am not sure if it is correct
- Add a comment about patches/patch-include_tig_tig.h
- Some graphical artifacts (e.g. where `main' and `diff' views are present)
  should be investigated and fixed

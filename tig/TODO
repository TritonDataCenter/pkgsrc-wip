- Investigate if we should install TESTS, if yes patches/patch-aa needed to be
  adjusted accordingly like devel/tig
- Review patches/patch-include_tig_display.h, I am not sure if it is correct
- Add a comment about patches/patch-include_tig_tig.h
- Why having two `review' worked upstream, can patches/patch-src_display.c
  be avoided?

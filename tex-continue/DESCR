The package is an amalgam of Donald Arseneau's fwlw package and
Luca Merciadri's turnthepage package. For multipage twoside
documents it puts a `continuation' mark near the foot of each
odd-numbered page that is followed by another page. The
position and form of the continuation mark may be altered.

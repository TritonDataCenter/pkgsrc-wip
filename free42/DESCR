Free42 is a software clone of the Hewlett-Packard 42S calculator. If you know
how to use an HP-42S, you know how to use Free42.
If you're new to the HP-42S and its clones, you may want to take a peek at the
manual. You can get a scan of the original manual, wrapped in a rather large
PDF file, by ordering the HP Museum CD/DVD-ROM set (highly recommended for any
HP calculator enthusiast). Go to http://hpmuseum.org/ to learn more.
Alternatively, you can get a free manual for the HP-42S and Free42 at

This is wip to udpate free42 to recent upstream.  Now, upstream uses
an intel bcd library, which does not straightforwardly build on
NetBSD.

* hook intel library into the build

* make intel library adequatly portable (or make it its own package)

* consider using the "upstream" distribution tarballs, which are
  versioned, and do not have the hp-logo skin

Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

FCEUmm (FCEUltra mappers modified) is a Famicom/NES (Nintendo
Entertainment System)/Dendy emulator that specializes in extensive
mapper support, making it useful for running unlicensed games. It runs
on lower-end systems than Nestopia.

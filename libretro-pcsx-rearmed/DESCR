Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

PCSX ReARMed is a Sony PlayStation1 video game system emulator.

PCSX ReARMed is a fork of PCSX Reloaded. It differs from the latter
in that it has special optimizations for systems that have an ARM
architecture-based CPU. It also has a dedicated graphics plugin,
'Exophase NEON GPU'. It is a surprisingly accurate graphics rasterizer
that also has the ability of rendering internally in high resolution at
playable framerates on ARM hardware.

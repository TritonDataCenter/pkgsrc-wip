nss-pam-ldapd provides a Name Service Switch (NSS) module that
allows an LDAP server to provide user account, group, host name,
alias, netgroup, and basically any other information that you
would normally get from /etc flat files or NIS.
It also provides a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) to do
authentication to an LDAP server.

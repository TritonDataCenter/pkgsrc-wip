libretro-bluemsx requires files from the full version of standalone
blueMSX - the Machines/ and Databases/ directories.

The zip can be downloaded here: http://bluemsx.msxblue.com/download.html

In retroarch, you'll need to place them in the System Directory.

Alternatively, you can place them in your Content Directory next to the
software you are going to run.

The dsk2rom utility (available in pkgsrc) can be used to convert disk
images (.dsk files) to make them possible to run in libretro-bluemsx.

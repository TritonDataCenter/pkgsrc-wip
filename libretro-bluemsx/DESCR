Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

blueMSX is a portable open source MSX computer system emulator that uses
an emulation model to achieve the highest level of accuracy possible.

The emulation engine in blueMSX is cycle accurate, which means that the
timing and synchronization between emulated hardware components appear the
same as on a real MSX. The goal is to replicate each individual component
as accurate as possible, which means that the emulator requires a more
high end computer than emulators optimized for speed.

It also emulates the Spectravideo SVI, ColecoVision, and Sega SG-1000.

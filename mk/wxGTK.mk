# This Makefile fragment is meant to be included by packages that
# require a wxGTK library.  wxGTK.mk will:
#
#	* set WXGTKBASE to the directory of wxGTK package
#	* set WXGTK_TYPE to the version of wxGTK used.
#
# Because multiple versions of wxGTK cannot currently coexist, the
# strategy is to use a single version, with each package building with
# it if possible and failing otherwise.
#
# There are two variables that can be used to influence the selection of
# the version of wxGTK.
#
# WXGTK_DEFAULT is a user-settable variable whose value is the default
#	version of wxGTK, for example WXGTK28 or WXGTK30.
#
# WXGTK_ACCEPTED is a package-settable list of wxGTK versions
#	that may be used by the package.
#

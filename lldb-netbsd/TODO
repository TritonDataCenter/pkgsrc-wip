Debugging to a file:
    log enable -STagnpstv -f /tmp/log.txt lldb all

Debugging GDB remote protocol commands:
    log enable gdb-remote packets

    https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Protocol.html

Debugging with gdb(1):
    Start the server:
        gdb --args lldb-server g *:1234 -- ./signal

    Start the client:
        lldb
    Inside it:
        process connect connect://localhost:1234


Introduce objc++ setup with gcc(1) for "make test":

Short-term goals in current milestone:
 - fix conflict with system-wide py-six
 - add support for auxv read operation
 - switch resolution of pid -> path to executable from /proc to sysctl(7)
 - recognize Real-Time Signals (SIGRTMIN-SIGRTMAX)
 - upstream !NetBSDProcessPlugin code
 - switch std::call_once to llvm::call_once
 + ptrace(2) interface to lock and unlock threads from execution
 + switch the current PT_WATCHPOINT interface to PT_GETDBREGS and PT_SETDBREGS

To be done later:
 - registers' accessors
 - single step support
 - thread resume/suspend operation
 - i386 support
 - upstream NetBSD support
 - adapt upstream Python tests to run on NetBSD and pass as many of them as
   possible
 - import LLDB into base
 - add NetBSD specific ATF tests verifying fundamental functionality of LLDB

and of course fix as many bugs as possible

libpatterns is a small, embeddable C library which gives your program a
pretty decent regular expression engine. You can think of it as PCRE on a
diet.

This library is essentially just a redistribution of the code from
patterns(7) from OpenBSD's httpd(8), which in turn is based on the
pattern-matching code from the Lua language.

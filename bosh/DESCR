The Schily Bourne Shell

The Schily Bourne Shell was derived from the Bourne Shell sources from
OpenSolaris.

The Schily Bourne Shell is actively maintained and enhanced on a regular base.
It can be compiled into three variants:
- The non-POSIX SVr4/OpenSolaris variant (obosh)
- The minimal POSIX compliant variant (pbosh)
- The POSIX compliant extended variant (bosh)
This package contains the third variant.

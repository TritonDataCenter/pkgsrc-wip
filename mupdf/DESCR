MuPDF is a lightweight PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to
within fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing
the look of a printed page on screen. MuPDF is also small, fast,
and yet complete.

MuPDF supports PDF 1.7 with transparency, encryption, hyperlinks,
annotations, searching and more. MuPDF also reads many other document
and e-book formats, such as XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ, EPUB and FictionBook
2.

MuPDF is written modularly, so features can be added and removed
by integrators if they so desire.

Since the 1.2 release of MuPDF, we have optional support for
interactive features such as form filling, javascript and transitions.

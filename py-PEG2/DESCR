Python is a nice scripting language. It even gives you access to
its own parser and compiler. It also gives you access to different
other parsers for special purposes like XML and string templates.

But sometimes you may want to have your own parser. This is what's
pyPEG for. And pyPEG supports Unicode.

pyPEG is a plain and simple intrinsic parser interpreter framework
for Python version 2.7 and 3.x. It is based on Parsing Expression
Grammar, PEG. With pyPEG you can parse many formal languages in a
very easy way.

Gambas is a free development environment and a full powerful development
platform based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, as easy as Visual
Basic.

This component allows you to compress and uncompress files, and to read and
write compressed files using standard stream methods. It allows you to compress
and uncompress strings in memory, too.

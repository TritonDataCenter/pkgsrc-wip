Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

Nestopia is a portable and cycle-accurate NES (Nintendo Entertainment
System) and Famicom emulator written in C++. Nestopia UE (Undead Edition)
is a fork of the original source code, with enhancements from members
of the emulation community. This includes support for new platforms,
and bug fixes in the emulator core.

It can emulate a Famicom Disk System, which requires the DISKSYS.ROM BIOS
file to be placed in the RetroArch system directory or content directory.

Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the
easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug
straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is
open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores
also in their own programs or devices.

Beetle/Mednafen PCE FAST is a TurboGrafx-16/NEC PC Engine/CD video game
system emulator.

New features and changes since tin-2.2.0

New features
------------
- simplified Chinese translation
- handle RFC 2231 parameter value continuation
- skip over RFC 2231 language parameters
- RFC 2231 decoding of non us-ascii MIME-parameter values
- options to color external quotes (extquote_handling, extquote_regex,
  col_extquote)
- LookupMessage ('L') in select level if reading via NNTP


Changes
-------
The gTLD list is no longer actively maintained (too many new gTLD recently),
disable_gnksa_domain_check=OFF might result in false positives.

--enable-heapsort is now default during configure (sort_function in tinrc
still needs to be set accordingly if you like to use heapsort instead of
qsort)

--enable-ipv6 is now default during configure

--enable-break-long-lines is now default during configure

sigfile=!/path/to/command no longer passes the name of the current
newsgroup to command. One can specify %G which will be replaced by
the name of the current newsgroup.
To match the old behaviour: 'sigfile=!/path/to/command %G'.

--enable-cancel-locks requires libcanlock-3 (which is included, but
some distros (e.g. debian) are linking against a shared lib which may
be too old).

Retired Features
----------------
. groupname_max_length, can now be set via user defined screen layout at
  select level

pkglint checks:

- WARN: PLIST:6: Manual page missing for bin/shrink_width
- WARN: PLIST:8: Manual page missing for bin/vips-8.3

Makefile:

- Add in Tiff buildlink? Also, should these be includes or DEPENDS, I'm still
  not sure?
- For whatever reason, since they switched to autogen with 8.4 I can't get this
  to build via Pkgsrc without having libexif as a requirement. Even though it
  should build fine without it; If I just extract the source and ./configure
  and make it builds fine without libexif, it's just via this Makefile, etc.
- Build from source instead of release bundle for more cross platform
  compatibility?

options.mk:

- Should add in all the optional dependencies.

distbb - distributed bulk build tool for pkgsrc

Key features:
   - several packages can be built at the same time on different
        machines or chroots
   - good design ;-)
   - extreame flexibility
   - compactness
   - no limit on a number of "slave" machines and/or chroots
   - fault tolerance, i.e. failure of slave hosts is not a problem
   - nice logging
   - ready for DESTDIR bulk builds

Of course it is based on pkg_summary-utils ;-)

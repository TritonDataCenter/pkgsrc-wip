- Haven't tested how Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD will react to the
  exclusion of linking libintl via |UNIX AND NOT APPLE| in CMakeLists.txt.
  But for now, it works on both NetBSD and macOS.

- Internal (lib)eb doesn't seem to honor CFLAGS.

- On NetBSD, `-std={c99,gnu99}' is required in CFLAGS for the build to succeed.
  However, it's not required for macOS/clang, and it in fact causes the build to fail
  on that platform.

  We could either set CFLAGS depending on the platform/compiler, or patch the zero-epwing
  code, since (at least at a cursory glance) it didn't look like too much would need to
  be changed.

- A kind and wise man has suggested that perhaps it *is* a good idea to
  make the fork of libeb included with the source code into its own pkg
  here on pkgsrc-wip.

  It'd certainly make things easier to work with if we did.

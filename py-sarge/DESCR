A wrapper for subprocess which provides command pipeline functionality.

The sarge package provides a wrapper for subprocess which provides command
pipeline functionality.

This package leverages subprocess to provide easy-to-use cross-platform
command pipelines with a Posix flavour: you can have chains of commands using
;, &, pipes using | and |&, and redirection.

LCOV is an extension of GCOV, a GNU tool which provides information
about what parts of a program are actually executed (i.e. "covered")
while running a particular test case. The extension consists of
a set of Perl scripts which build on the textual GCOV output
to implement the following enhanced functionality:

  * HTML based output: coverage rates are additionally
    indicated using bar graphs and specific colors.

  * Support for large projects: overview pages allow quick
    browsing of coverage data by providing three levels of
    detail: directory view, file view and source code view.

LCOV was initially designed to support Linux kernel
coverage measurements, but works as well for coverage
measurements on standard user space applications.

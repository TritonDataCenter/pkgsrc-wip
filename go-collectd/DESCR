This is a very simple package and very much a Work in Progress, so
expect things to move around and be renamed a lot.

The repository is organized as follows:
 * Package collectd.org/api declares data structures you may already
   know from the collectd source code itself, such as ValueList.
 * Package collectd.org/exec declares some utilities for writing
   binaries to be executed with the exec plugin. It provides some
   utilities (getting the hostname, e.g.) and an executor which you
   may use to easily schedule function calls.
 * Package collectd.org/format declares functions for formatting
   ValueLists in other format. Right now, only PUTVAL is implemented.
   Eventually I plan to add parsers for some formats, such as the
   JSON export.
 * Package collectd.org/network implements collectd's binary network
   protocol. It offers client and server implementations, see
   network.Client and network.ListenAndWrite() for more details.

* conf files

Decide on if a mosquitto config file should be installed in etc, or if
a user should take a few lines from the (large) example as needed.

* build tools

Figure out cmake vs gmake.  Perhaps this is just gdt being confused.

* patches

Rename to standard filenames a la mkpatches.

For each, document why and file upstream/include ref or explain why
upstream is inappropriate.

* sunos shlib

Figure out why the soname is different on sunos, and if this is an
upstream bug.  Perhaps resolve, or perhaps use a PLIST variable to
avoid having a second copy.

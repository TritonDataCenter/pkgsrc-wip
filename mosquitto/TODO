* update

update to 1.5

* conf files

Decide on if a mosquitto config file should be installed in etc, or if
a user should take a few lines from the (large) example as needed.

Document our strategy for modifying the example file, explaining if it
is reflecting compiled-in defaults, or some other reasons.

* build tools

Depending on response from upstream, document our approach to using
cmake always.

* patches

Rename to standard filenames a la mkpatches.

For each, document why and file upstream/include ref or explain why
upstream is inappropriate.

** ldconfig

Upstream appears to run ldconfig on "UNIX", which is incorrect.  File
a bug about this.

* sunos shlib

Figure out why the soname is different on sunos, and if this is an
upstream bug.  Perhaps resolve, or perhaps use a PLIST variable to
avoid having a second copy.


* security

This package has known vulnerabilities, please investigate and fix if possible:
 CVE-2017-7653, CVE-2017-7654

Rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, among others, MySQL,
PostgreSQL, failover log destinations, syslog/tcp, fine grain
output format control, high precision timestamps, queued operations
and the ability to filter on any message part. It is quite
compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in
replacement.

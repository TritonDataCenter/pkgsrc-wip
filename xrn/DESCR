XRN is a Usenet News reader for the X window system.

XRN strives to adhere to all relevant standards (except MIME) and to
help users avoid the common pitfalls of participation in the Usenet.
To that end, all releases of XRN starting with 9.02 are compliant with
the Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval (GNKSA), a standard which defines
how News readers should behave to make the Usenet a better place for
everyone.  See <http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/> for more information
about the GNKSA.  XRN's GNKSA review can be viewed at
<http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/Evaluations/xrn-9.02beta4.txt>.

XRN is maintained by Jonathan Kamens.  Bug reports or comments about
it should be sent to <mailto:bug-xrn@kamens.brookline.ma.us>.
Please do *not* write to that address with basic questions about
compiling the program; if you are unfamiliar with compiling X
applications, you should seek help at your site.

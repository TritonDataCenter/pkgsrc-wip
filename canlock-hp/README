1) General
libcanlock contains no header parser because some programs already have one.
If your program uses libcanlock (e.g. via canlock frontend in a script) and has
no header parser, the utilities in this package can be used to fill the gap.


2) System requirements
- POSIX.1-2001 conformant operating system
- POSIX C-Language Development Utilities (c99, lex, yacc)

flex and bison are automatically detected as replacements for lex and yacc.


Note:
Because it would add additional dependencies and make porting to non-POSIX
operating systems harder, the utilities in this package are not included
in the libcanlock package.

- Is patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_jit_ExecutableAllocator.cpp relevant
  for NetBSD? (probably not, `&& !defined(__FreeBSD__) && !defined(__NetBSD__)'
  can be probably removed after testing it)
- Review JIT support for NetBSD:
   * patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_MachineContext.h
   * patches/patch-Source_WTF_wtf_Platform.h
  Only amd64 was actually tested and arm, arm64 and mips really need a
  double-check.
- Enable webkit-jit option
- Could the NetBSD logic in
  patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_MachineContext.h be rewritten
  using ucontext(2) _UC_MACHINE_* macros instead?
- Would it be useful to define HAVE_BACKTRACE and HAVE_BACKTRACE_SYMBOLS?
  (these are not probably per-OS but just a matter of include devel/libexecinfo
  and adjust Source/WTF/wtf/Platform.h)

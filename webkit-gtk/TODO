- Should we install stuffs installed in ${PREFIX}/libexec/webkit2gtk-4.0/ in ${PREFIX}/bin/
  instead (at least MiniBrowser and eventually jsc?)

- After using any webkit-gtk browser on - at least NetBSD/amd64 8.99.1 there are
  errors of the following forms:

   Error sending IPC message: Message too long
  
  ...according a quick grep the code path involved seems in
  Source/WebKit2/Platform/IPC/unix/ConnectionUnix.cpp:Connection::sendOutputMessage()
  ...and the process program is WebKitNetworkPro.

  Changing default SOCKET_TYPE to `SOCK_STREAM' seems to fix that (so treating
  NetBSD like Darwin!) seems to fix this issue.

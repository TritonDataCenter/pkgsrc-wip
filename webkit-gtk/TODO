- Readd - if needed - SunOS patches removed for 2.18.2 (logic pretty different
  compared to 2.16.6), these are:

   * patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_heap_MachineStackMarker.cpp
   * patches/patch-Source_WTF_wtf_Compiler.h

    -- leot (2017/11/08)

- Think and discuss about `GCC_REQD= 5.0'. At least after 2.18 maintaining such
  patches does not seem trivial. At the moment the kludge is no longer present
  due that and to avoid maintaining further pkgsrc local patches.

- After using any webkit-gtk browser on - at least NetBSD/amd64 8.99.1 there are
  errors of the following forms:

   Error sending IPC message: Message too long
  
  ...according a quick grep the code path involved seems in
  Source/WebKit2/Platform/IPC/unix/ConnectionUnix.cpp:Connection::sendOutputMessage()
  ...and the process program is WebKitNetworkPro.

  It is worth to verify that the EMSGSIZE is provoked by the sendmsg(2) calls in
  the sendOutputMessage() method.

- `webkit-jit' option no longer works (not even compiles!). If possible fix it
   and look at patches available in OpenBSD ports in order to get an idea on how
   to handle them (and of course, also integrate them so that OpenBSD pkgsrc
   users will benefit of that too!).

- Should we install stuffs installed in ${PREFIX}/libexec/webkit2gtk-4.0/ in ${PREFIX}/bin/
  instead (at least MiniBrowser and eventually jsc?)

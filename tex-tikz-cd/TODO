I've verified that the sizes and md5 hashes of the distfiles for this
package and its doc package match those for the tikz-cd entry in the
current version of the texlive package database in
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz

Migration to the main pkgsrc tree:

* Precedents for location:
  - The texlive package lives in graphics/pgf/contrib/tikz-cd.
  - Existing pkgsrc packages from texlive collection-pictures include:
      graphics/tex-asyfig
      print/tex-curves
      graphics/tex-eepic
      print/tex-here
      print/tex-pb-diagram
      print/tex-pgf
      print/tex-pgfplots
      print/tex-picinpar
      print/tex-pict2e
      graphics/tex-pictex
      graphics/tex-tikz-3dplot
      graphics/tex-tikzinclude
      graphics/tex-tikzmark
      graphics/tex-tikzorbital
      graphics/tex-tikzpagenodes
      graphics/tex-tikzpfeile
      graphics/tex-tikzposter
      graphics/tex-tikzscale
      graphics/tex-tikzsymbols
      print/tex-tufte-latex
      graphics/tex-xypic
    I see no unambiguous pattern.  tex-tikz-cd could go in any of
    graphics, math, or print, as I've indicated in CATEGORIES.

* tikz-cd is part of the texlive "collection-pictures" package set,
  which pkgsrc mirrors partially in meta-pkgs/texlive-collection-pictures.
  Thus, when tex-tikz-cd{,-doc} migrate to the main pkgsrc tree, the
  comment line
    # depend tikz-cd
  in meta-pkgs/texlive-collection-pictures/Makefile should be changed
  to
    DEPENDS+=	tex-tikz-cd-[0-9]*:../../<category>/tex-tikz-cd
  where <category> is whatever ends up being the immediate parent
  directory.

  There doesn't seem to be a corresponding texlive-collection-pictures-doc
  meta package.  Should there be?  FWIW: I like having installed
  documentation, and it's a pain to have to list each of the tex doc
  packages separately in pkg_chk.conf.

* IIUC, pkgsrc mirrors the distribution files for texlive packages,
  presumably because they are not explicitly versioned.  So part of
  the migration would require copying the distribution files to the
  pkgsrc mirrors and removing from the Makefiles for tex-tikz-cd
  and tex-tikz-cd-doc the "TEXLIVE_USE_CTAN= yes" lines.

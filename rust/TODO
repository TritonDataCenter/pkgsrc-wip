IMPORTANT:
lacking an install / PLIST! (XXX use DESTDIR?)
Need bootstrap for platforms for which upstream doesn't release binaries
Fetching shit to ~/.cargo (XXX prepare combined tarball, use HOME as an environment variable)

Secondary:
Test target doesn't work

Maybe not worth caring about:
LLVM is builtin, not a dependency (jakllsch mentions it might be hard to tear out)

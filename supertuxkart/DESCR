SuperTuxKart is a free 3d kart racing game; we want to make the
game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with
up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each other or just try
to beat the computer.

See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the
pyramids. Race underground or in space, watching the stars passing
by. Have some rest under the palms on the beach (watching the other
karts overtaking you :) ). But don't eat the bananas! Watch for
bowling balls, plungers, bubble gum and cakes thrown by opponents.

You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of
several Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on
your own, play battle mode against your friends, and more!

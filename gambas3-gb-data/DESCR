Gambas is a free development environment and a full powerful development
platform based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, as easy as Visual
Basic.

This component provides implementations of various Abstract Datatypes (ADT).
Those are data containers with a well-defined interface but variable
implementation. All the classes are built around the Variant datatype of Gambas.

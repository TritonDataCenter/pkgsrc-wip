Wine is a program which allows running Microsoft Windows programs
(including DOS, Windows 3.x and Win32 executables) on Unix.  It consists
of a program loader which loads and executes an Microsoft Windows binary,
and a library that implements Windows API calls using their Unix or X11
equivalents.  The library may also be used for porting Win32 code into
native Unix executables.

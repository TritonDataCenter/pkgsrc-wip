This version of fs-uae has unbundled the graphical settings and launching
program.

Install wip/fs-uae-launcher if you want it, but you can still run fs-uae
and change your settings with a text editor if you don't.

If the emulation window does not open, you may need to recompile SDL2
with the opengl option (PKG_OPTIONS.SDL2 += opengl).

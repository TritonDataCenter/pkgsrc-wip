OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
(RCT2), expanding the game with new features, fixing bugs and
raising game limits. The gameplay revolves around building and
maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and
facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a
good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy.  OpenRCT2
allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the
player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst
sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with
optionally no restrictions or finance.

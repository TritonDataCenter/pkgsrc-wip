The hanging package facilitates the typesetting of hanging
paragraphs. The package also enables typesetting with hanging
punctuation, by making punctuation characters active. This
facility is best suppressed (it can interfere with other
packages) -- there are package options for suppressing each
individual punctuation character. 'Real' attempts at hanging
punction should nowadays use the microtype package, which takes
advantage of the support offered in recent versions of pdfTeX.

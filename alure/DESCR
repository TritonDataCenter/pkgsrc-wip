ALURE is a utility library to help manage common tasks with OpenAL
applications. This includes device enumeration and initialization, file
loading, and streaming.

The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality that would
otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for various projects and
platforms, such as loading a sound file into an OpenAL buffer and streaming an
audio file through a buffer queue. Support for different formats is consistant
across platforms, so no special checks are needed when loading files, and all
formats are handled through the same API.

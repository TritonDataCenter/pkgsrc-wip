Gambas is a free development environment and a full powerful development
platform based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, as easy as Visual
Basic.

This package uses the ttf fonts parts of the SDL library. If opengl drivers are
installed it uses them to accelerate 2D and 3D drawing.

This component is deprecated.

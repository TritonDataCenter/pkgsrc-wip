I no longer want to work on gcc. Some hints if somebody wants to continue:

1) I have integrated several patches from lang/gccXY and lang/gcc-aux
over the years. My contributions concentrated around gfortran and keeping
gcc buildable on NetBSD. The present state of gcc{48, 49, 410}snasphot
looks quite good in my opinion, so it is a good time to let others
take over. I just want to have more time for other things.

2) The test_summary.log from NetBSD current shows several errors
caused by long double complex functions present in complex.h but
not yet implemented im libm. See the added prototypes in 
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/include/complex.h.diff?r1=1.3&r2=1.4&only_with_tag=MAIN
GCC configure only compiles a test file without a link step , assuming
that a function is present in libm then. The only real fix is commiting
implementations to libm. FreeBSD has nearly all functions necessary
for C99/C11 are known to have the highest quality. OpenBSD also has
the missing functions available.

Have fun,

Kai-Uwe

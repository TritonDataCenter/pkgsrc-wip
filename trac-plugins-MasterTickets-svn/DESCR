The MasterTickets trac plugin adds "blocks" and "blocked by" fields to
each ticket, enabling you to express dependencies between tickets. It
also provides a GraphvizPlugin-based dependency-graph feature for
those tickets having dependencies specified, allowing you to visually
understand the dependency tree. The dependency graph is viewable by
clicking 'depgraph' in the context (in the upper right corner) menu
when viewing a ticket that blocks or is blocked by another ticket.

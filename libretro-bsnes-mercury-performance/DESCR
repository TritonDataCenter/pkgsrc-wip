Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

bsnes is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom video
game system emulator that aims to document SNES/SFC hardware with an
extremely high degree of accuracy without compromise or optimisation.
As such, it has quite high system requirements. For a SNES/SFC libretro
emulation core that balances performance and accuracy to an acceptable
level for 99% of games, consider using a snes9x core.

bsnes-mercury is a fork of bsnes aiming to restore some useful features
that have been removed, as well as improving performance a bit. Maximum
accuracy is still uncompromisable; anything that affects accuracy is
optional and off by default.

It has has 3 different profiles: Performance, Balanced, and Accuracy.
The Balanced version is recommended for modern PCs. Use the Accuracy
profile only for extreme cases. For more information, see:

The differences between the three profiles reflect differences in
documented hardware behaviour versus actual hardware behaviour.

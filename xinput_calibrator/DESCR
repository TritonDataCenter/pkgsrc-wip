Because all existing calibrators were driver dependent and hard to use,
xinput_calibrator was created. The goal of xinput_calibrator is to:

* work for any Xorg driver (use Xinput to get axis valuators),
* output the calibration as Xorg.conf, HAL policy and udev rule,
* support advanced driver options, such as Evdev's dynamic calibration,
* have a very intuitive GUI (normal X client).

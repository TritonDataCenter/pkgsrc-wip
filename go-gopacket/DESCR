Package gopacket provides packet decoding for the Go language.

gopacket contains many sub-packages with additional functionality you
may find useful, including:

* layers: You'll probably use this every time.  This contains of the
    logic built into gopacket for decoding packet protocols.  Note
    that all example code below assumes that you have imported both
    gopacket and gopacket/layers.
* pcap: C bindings to use libpcap to read packets off the wire.
* pfring: C bindings to use PF_RING to read packets off the wire.
* afpacket: C bindings for Linux's AF_PACKET to read packets off the
    wire.
* tcpassembly: TCP stream reassembly

Qweyboard aims to be a Velotype/Veyboard like
experience on a regular standard computer keyboard.

The Velotype/Veyboard is an orthographic, stenographic keyboard
which lets you type really fast by exploiting language
features. It's primarily used with European languages such
as Swedish and Dutch, and it works great for English too.

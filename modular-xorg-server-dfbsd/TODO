Copy port to x11/modular-xorg-server, do not install from wip.

Waiting for devd patches required on latest FreeBSD and DragonFly
submitted in
pkg/50200 (x11/modular-xorg-server)
to be accepted.

Normal pkgsrc configure no longer works, need full autoreconf instead.
Put autoreconf in pre-patch because not sure how else to apply
patches to configure.

Unsure whether RegisterBlockAndWakeupHandlers() and
RemoveBlockAndWakeupHandlers() are used anymore after 1.19 API shift.

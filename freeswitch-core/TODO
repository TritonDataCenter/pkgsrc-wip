I pretty much gave up on Freeswitch but I was asked to drop what I had
into wip so that others could continue it if they wanted.  You need to
be able to build the distfile to make it work.  Here is the script that
I used to do that.  Adjust as needed for your environment.

#! /bin/sh
# makes a fake dist file from git head

cd /home/darcy/git/freeswitch-1.2.3
make clean
cd ..
tar cvzjf /usr/NetBSD/cvs/pkgsrc/distfiles/freeswitch/freeswitch-1.2.3.tar.bz2 freeswitch-1.2.3
cd /usr/NetBSD/cvs/pkgsrc/net/freeswitch-core
make makesum

libcanlock is a library for creating and verifying RFC 8315 Netnews
Cancel-Locks. This implementation uses the recommended algorithm from
Section 4 with HMAC based on the same hash function as <scheme>.

A command line utility "canlock" is built together with the library.

Additional header parsers (for the receiving side) are available in the
package canlock-hp.

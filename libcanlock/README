1) General
libcanlock is a standalone implementation without external dependencies.
If your program already uses a library that contains functions for hash and
base64 algorithms (e.g. OpenSSL), it is recommended that you use them instead
(to avoid code duplication).


2) System requirements
- POSIX.1-2001 compliant operating system
- C99 compiler with 'int' data type of at least 32 bit width


3) API
Since version 3 there is a new API available (hash algorithm independent).
Man pages for this API are installed together with the library.

Anything that is not documented should be considered as internal and not
part of the API. There is no portable way to hide all the internal stuff
completely, but expect that a future version may no longer export it without
notice.


4) Backward compatibility
The old API from version 2 is still emulated, but it is now deprecated and
undocumented.

Including the header file from the new location, recompile and relink should
be sufficient to port an existing application to version 3 of the library.
It is also possible to install both version 2 and version 3 of the library
in parallel.

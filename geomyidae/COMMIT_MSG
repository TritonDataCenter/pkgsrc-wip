geomyidae: Import geomyidae-0.32.2 as wip/geomyidae

Based on net/Geomyidae.

pkgsrc changes:
 - Update DISTNAME, PKGNAME, MASTER_SITES and HOMEPAGE
 - Avoid NO_CONFIGURE=yes, also if a package does not provide a configure script
   it is not needed and can lead to confusion due the several configure targets
   that are removed
 - Add several variable to BUILD_DEFS
 - Honor GEOMYIDAE_USER, GEOMYIDAE_GROUP and GEOMYIDAE_ROOTDIR variables that
   will respectively set the user, group and rootdir of geomyidae
 - Instead of copypasting several rc scripts write a new ones ad-hoc for pkgsrc
   that will run geomyidae unprivileged honoring the several GEOMYIDAE_*
   variables
 - Do not install a LICENSE file (we have the LICENSE variable for it!)


Changes:
Geomyidae v0.32.2 fixes release
-------------------------------
Another fixes release for geomyidae is out. Now hopefully the OpenBSD people
fixed the whole pledge support in geomyidae.


Geomyidae v0.32.1 fixes release
-------------------------------
Soon after the v0.32 release I received patches, which I do not want to miss
in mainline.

* Fix and make OpenBSD pledge support better.
* Fix a typo in the slackware init script.

Thanks for all who sent in patches! All further patches are welcome!


Geomyidae v0.32 Release
-----------------------
I am glad to announce the release of geomyidae v0.32. Thanks to all the
contributors and people giving ideas!

Here is what changed:
        * Minor fixed in the manpage, CGI handling and tools.
        * Add example for tt escaping in the manpage.
        * Add nocgi flag, which disables CGI execution.
        * Add OpenBSD pledge support.


Geomyidae v0.31.1 release
-------------------------

There has been a geomyidae v0.31.1 release which fixes a major issue of the
pending bytes logic from v0.31.

Have fun!


Geomyidae v0.31 release
-----------------------
I  am proud to announce the geomyidae v0.31 release. There were
some major issues fixed, so a new release is necessary:

* There is now gph vim syntax highlighting files in the archive.
* Gopher+ compatibility mode.
* No sockets are left behind anymore.
* New log format of geomyidae is now documented in the manpage.
* There was some ugly bug with curl connecting to a Linux system, where after
  close() some bytes were lost. Now some check is added to be sure all data
  has been sent to the client. If you want to have bad dreams, look at the
  curl sourcecode.

Thanks for everyone contributing!


Geomyidae 0.29 release
----------------------
I am happy to announce the 0.29 release of geomyidae, a simple gopher server.
What has been changed:

* the OpenBSD rc.d files have been fixed due to arg.h fixes
* index.bin support added
        * Create a file with the raw gopher menu content in a directory and is
          served by geomyidae.
        * This is useful for scripts generating static gopher content
        * This is useful for serving a backup of a gopherhole.
* show errors on fork, in case there are constraints on process resources
* care for send errors
* huge speed up on different platforms when transferring huge binary files
        * Linux is using sendfile(2) and TCP_CORK
        * FreeBSD and DragonflyBSD are using sendfile(2)
        * TCP_NOPUSH is used on all BSDs
        * TCP_NODELAY is disabled on nearly all platforms
        * other platforms (like OpenBSD) have a speed increase due to an
          alignment of the send buffer to blocksize of the socket

I want to thank all contributors! All patches are welcome!

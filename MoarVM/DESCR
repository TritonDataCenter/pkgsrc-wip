Short for "Metamodel On A Runtime", MoarVM is a virtual machine built
especially for Rakudo Perl 6 and the NQP Compiler Toolchain. The primary
backend target for the Christmas 2015 release of Perl 6, MoarVM stands
out amongst the various Rakudo and NQP compilation targets by:

- Running the Perl 6 specification test suite in the least time
- Passing more of the Perl 6 specification tests than Rakudo Perl 6 on
  other backends
- Having the lowest memory usage
- Having the best startup time
- Being fastest to build both NQP and Rakudo - and thus your Perl 6 and
  NQP programs too!
- Being the only backend to support strings at grapheme level

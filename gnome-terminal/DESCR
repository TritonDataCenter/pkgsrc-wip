An xterm like program for GNOME 2.  This is a terminal thing that isn't
finished at all.  See TODO for more information.

How it works
===

Profiles -
  all settings are stored in profiles. prefs dialog edits the current
  profile

Session -
  just the number of open windows/tabs and their profile is stored
  per-session

Command line options -
  do not overlap things that are preferences

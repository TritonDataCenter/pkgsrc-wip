Vamp is an audio processing plugin system for plugins that extract descriptive
information from audio typically referred to as audio analysis plugins or
audio feature extraction plugins.

Just like an audio effects plugin (such as a VST), a Vamp plugin is a binary
module that can be loaded up by a host application and fed audio data. However,
unlike an effects plugin, a Vamp plugin generates not more audio, but some sort
of symbolic information. Typical things that a Vamp plugin might calculate
include the locations of moments such as note onset times, visualisable
representations of the audio such as spectrograms, or curve data such as power
or fundamental frequency.

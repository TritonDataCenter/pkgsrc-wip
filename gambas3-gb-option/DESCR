Gambas is a free development environment and a full powerful development
platform based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, as easy as Visual
Basic.

This component implements a command-line arguments parser based on the GNU
getopt() function.

This component is deprecated. Use gambas3-gb-args instead.

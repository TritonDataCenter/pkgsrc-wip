This is a port of OpenBSD's excellent cwm[0] to Linux and other Unices.

cwm is a window manager for X11 which contains many features that
concentrate on the efficiency and transparency of window management.  cwm
also aims to maintain the simplest and most pleasant aesthetic.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.
Releases are roughly coordinated.

girara is a library that implements a user interface that focuses on simplicity
and minimalism. Currently based on GTK+, a cross-platform widget toolkit, it
provides an interface that focuses on three main components: A so-called view
widget that represents the actual application (e.g. a website (browser), an
image (image viewer) or the document (document viewer)), an input bar that is
used to execute commands of the application and the status bar which provides
the user with current information. girara was designed to replace and enhance
the user interface that is used by zathura and jumanji and other features that
those applications share.

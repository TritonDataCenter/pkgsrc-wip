QCad is an application for computer aided drafting in two dimensions. With QCad
you can create technical drawings such as plans for buildings, interiors or
mechanical parts. QCad drawing files are in DXF format (DXF 2004, R12),
permitting interchange with a wide variety of CAD systems.  See also
qcad-manual-(your language) and qcad-partlibrary to complete an installation.

This package builds from the Community Edition sources, released under the

which adds a scripting module and support, is available for several platforms;
see the QCad home page.

PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational
database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables" the PostgreSQL server,
allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database for geographic information
systems (GIS), much like ESRI's SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS
follows the OpenGIS "Simple Features Specification for SQL" and has been
certified as compliant with the "Types and Functions" profile.

PostGIS/PostgreSQL includes the following functionality:
* Simple Features as defined by the OpenGIS Consortium (OGC)
* Support for Well-Known Text and Well-Known Binary representations of GIS
  objects
* Fast spatial indexing using GiST
* Geospatial analysis functions
* PostgreSQL JDBC extension objects corresponding to the geometries
* Support for OGC access functions as defined by the Simple Features
  Specification

This is postgis 2.x, the currently-maintained and recommended version.

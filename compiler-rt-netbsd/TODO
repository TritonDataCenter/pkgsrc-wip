- Add alert (Printf() & Die()) that if ASLR/NetBSD is detected, tsan isn't possible.
  Technically we can workaround it with ReExec() and similar tricks
  but since it can be disabled on per-application basis - require it on NetBSD for
  tsan aware applications.
  This might be comparable in future for msan/NetBSD.
- FreeBSD reports issue in AsanTSDInit(), it calls pthread_key_create() while
  libthr.so is not loaded, and that causes pthread_key_create() to always return
  ENOSYS. https://reviews.llvm.org/D39254
  Check whether it is valid for NetBSD.

- Fix remaining issues in Sanitizers.

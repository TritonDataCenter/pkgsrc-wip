Golly is an open source, cross-platform application for exploring
Conway's Game of Life and many other types of cellular automata.

Golly's key features:

Supports bounded and unbounded universes, with cells of up to 256
states.  Supports multiple algorithms, including Bill Gosper's super
fast hashlife algorithm.  Many different types of CA are included: John
von Neumann's 29-state CA, Wolfram's 1D rules, WireWorld, Generations,
Paterson's Worms, Larger than Life, etc.  The RuleLoader algorithm lets
you plug in new rules.  Responsive even while generating or garbage
collecting.  Reads RLE, macrocell, Life 1.05/1.06, dblife, and MCell
files.  Can also read common graphic formats: BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF.  Can
extract patterns, rules and scripts from zip files.  Can download
patterns, rules and scripts from online archives.  Includes a
state-of-the-art pattern collection.  Can paste in patterns from the
clipboard.  Unlimited undo/redo.  Configurable keyboard shortcuts.  Auto
fit option keeps patterns sized to the window.  Full screen option (no
menu/status/tool/scroll bars).  Supports multiple layers, including
cloned layers.  HTML-based help with an integrated Life Lexicon.
Scriptable via Lua or Python.

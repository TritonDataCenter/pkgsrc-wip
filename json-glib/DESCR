JSON-GLib is a library providing serialization and deserialization support for
the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format described by RFC 4627

JSON-GLib uses GLib native data types and the generic value container GValue for
ease of development. It also provides integration with the GObject classes for
direct serialization into, and deserialization from, JSON data streams.
